Hello, this is meant to be a logbook where I can detail configurations that I have made to 
my raspberry pi as well as helpful commands that I want to remember in case I forget later on.

systemctl 
systemctl status ssh.socket #gives info on ssh socket connections this session
systemctl enable ssh.socket #enables ssh into machine

I should probably mention that I spent longer than I would like to admit on updating /boot/config.txt so
that I can use SPI. I have a waveshare e-paper display (epd) that I want to turn into a terminal display.

After some fiddling, I got the waveshare python libraries to work under my current os install. 
This was not super difficult, but there was a lot of going over and making sure that I had the
required packages installed. Luckily, thispis OS seems to have a lot more useful libraries than the 
raspberry pi OS (formerly Raspbian). 

spidev is a library that is installed (and reinstalled), but somehow I messed up the install so that 
I cannot run `python3 main.py`, but have to run it under `sudo python3 main.py`. All of the packages
are there, so I would have assumed that I don't need privileged access to run the py file.
